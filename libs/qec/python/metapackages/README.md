# CUDA-Q QEC Library

CUDA-Q QEC is a high-performance quantum error correction library that leverages
NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate classical decoding and processing of quantum error
correction codes. The library provides optimized implementations of common QEC
tasks including syndrome extraction, decoding, and logical operation tracking.

This is package is a meta-package that when installed, simply installs the
